Cartpole Simulation Read Me:

Lagrangian Mechanics is a systematic method to analyze a system of motion in three dimensions through energy consideration using calculus, as opposed to the traditional two dimensional study using Newtonâ€™s Laws. In the cartpole simulation, we utilize the Euler-Lagrange equation to model the motion of both a simple and inverted pendulum (cartpole). Having these motion models allow the implementation of them into the simulation code (, making for a working animation of a simple pendulum and cartpole. These animations can be viewed in singlePendulumAnimation.mp4 and cartpoleAnimation.mp4 respectively. For more information about the overall project, visit the CartpoleLagrangianResearch.pdf in the Cartpole-Simulation repository.
