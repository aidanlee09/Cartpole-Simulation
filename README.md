Cartpole Simulation Read Me:

Lagrangian Mechanics is a systematic method to analyze a system of motion in three dimensions through energy consideration using calculus, as opposed to the traditional two dimensional study using Newtonâ€™s Laws. In the cartpole simulation, we utilize the Euler-Lagrange equation to model the motion of both a simple and inverted pendulum.
